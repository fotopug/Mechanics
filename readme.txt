This repo is an archive of scripts used to control various mechanicals in the Riddle Room. It's currently being overhauled and probably won't ever have applicability beyond the Riddle Room. On the upside, you can probably infer how to unlock some of the puzzles if you can make your way through a mess of terrible C++ written years ago.
